/// async` function runs on its *caller's* executor — so the whole ladder, including synchronous
/// AX reads that can each block for the full two-second messaging timeout and a tree walk
/// measured at 1.2 s, was executing on the main thread. One unresponsive target app could hang
/// the menu bar UI. Marking the engine types `nonisolated` did not move them; only giving the
/// work its own actor does.
///
/// **Why elements never leave.** `AXUIElement` is not `Sendable` (verified against the SDK), so
/// an `AXElement` crossing an isolation boundary would be a data race the compiler is right to
/// reject. Every method here therefore accepts `Sendable` inputs — a pid, a locator, a string —
/// and returns `Sendable` output. Elements are created, used, and discarded inside.
